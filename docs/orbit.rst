Orbit, SAA and GTIs
===================

ixpeobssim includes a simplified representation of the IXPE orbit. This allows
to calculate the SAA epochs, the target occultation and, ultimately, the
good time intervals, in a realistic fashion. While many of these capabilities
are similar to those done by the Science Operations Center (SOC) for mission
planning, we caution that these capabilities in no way supersede or replace
those done by the SOC. They are primarily designed to help account for
observational realities when simulating event lists.


Baseline orbit
--------------

IXPE was launched on December 9, 2021, in an orbit characterized by:

* altitude: 601.1 km
* inclination: 0.23 decimal degrees
* eccentricity: 0.0012

For the purpose of ``ixpeobssim`` simulation we dynamically generate a
`TLE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set>`_ matching the
official TLE retrieved right after launch

.. code-block::

   IXPE
   1 49954U 21121A   21351.00640149  .00001120  00000-0  35770-4 0  9994
   2 49954   0.2300 281.7657 0011347 134.4260 303.9164 14.90740926  1166

While we are aware that this TLE will no be valid for the lifetime of the IXPE
mission, this approximation was tentatively deemed sufficient for the
purpose of simulation observations. (In general we don't aim at getting the
actual GTI for a real observation, just realistic ones.)
For completeness, we use the `skyfield <https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/>`_ Python
package to deal with all the aspects discussed in this section, and the
user is referred to the package documentation for more background information.

.. note::
   The nominal mean motion of 14.9 revolutions per day (at an altitude of
   600 km) corresponds to a period of 5800 s. Along with the duration of the
   SAA epochs (810 s on average), this is one of the two fundamental timescales
   for IXPE observations.

   (For completeness, due to the rotation of the Earth, the average time distance
   between two consecutive SAA entries is 6210 s.)

The South Atlantic Anomaly
--------------------------

We parametrize the
`South Atlantic Anomaly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Anomaly>`_
(SAA) as a 12-vertex convex polygon in Earth coordinates. The initial definition
of the polygon is based on the heritage of other observatories (e.g., Fermi LAT
and GBM, AGILE) and may be refined after launch, but it is more than adequate
for pre-launch simulations.

.. note::
   During the SAA passages in nominal science operations we will lower the
   high voltage for the focal-plane detectors and we shall not acquire science
   data. It follows that the SAA is one of the fundamental ingredients for
   determining the good time intervals for the observation.

IXPE being in nearly-equatorial orbits, the duration of the SAA epochs is
approximately the same at each passage, the overall variations being of the
order of a few %.

.. _figure-ixpe_trajectory_saa:

.. figure:: figures/misc/ixpe_saa_epochs.*
   :width: 80%

   Distribution of the duration of the SAA epochs over 161 consecutive passages.

.. note::
   With an average SAA epoch duration of 813 s every 6213 s, the average
   fraction of time spent by IXPE in the SAA is about 13%.



Earth Occultation
-------------------

A simple consideration of the IXPE orbit geometry (a 600 km altitude orbit above
a planet with a radius of 6300 km) makes it clear that a large fraction of the
sky will be obstructed by the Earth. Just as the SOC is using in the planning
stages of the mission, we assume that a particular sky position is occulted by
the Earth whenever the minimum altitude of the line of sight is less than 200 km.


A baseline expectation and rule of thumb for observers is that any particular
target with declinations in the range of -50 to 50 degrees will be occulted by
the Earth for approximately 40% of an orbit. Sources  in the declination range
of 50-70 degrees experience less time in occultation, and is effectively negligible for
sources beyond +/- 70 degrees declination.

For a given target, the fraction of the orbit where the target is occulted by
the Earth can be safely treated as a constant value on both short time scales
(days or weeks) as well as longer time scales (months or years). No position on
the sky should have particular "window of visibilty" where it is observable for
unusually long periods of time.

We finally caution that this calculation in particular does not account for some
of the expected higher-order effects that will impact the GTI fraction. As an
example, the oblateness of the Earth (which will affect the visibility of a
target in particular directions) is not modeled here. Tests against the SOC's
tools show that these corrections may affect the total amount of time on-source
at about the 1 percent level. Using the target 3C273 as one test case, we found
that the SOC predicts this source is visible for 60.0275 percent of the orbit
while the calculations included here predict that 3C273 is visible 60.934 percent.


Sun Pitch Angle
-------------------

Another observational constraint implemented in ixpeobssim is the times of year
where a particular target source right ascension and declination is properly
separated from the Sun. We currently set the default separations (hereafter the
Sun pitch angle) to reside between 65 and 115 degrees. These restrictions will
not affect the GTI's directly (as the Sun pitch angle does not vary significantly
over the course of a day or week long exposure) but may help motivate a more
sensible choice of start date or help with scheduling a larger number of targets.
As stated above, these calculations should only be treated as approximations for
the observation planning tools utilized and/or provided by the SOC.


Good time intervals
-------------------

The wall-clock time of the observation in xpobssim is controlled by four
command-line parameters:

* ``startdate``: the start date of the observation (default: "2022-04-21"),
  assumed to be in UTC. This is a string in the ``%Y-%m-%d`` (if you don't care
  about the precise hour of the day) or ``%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f`` (if you do)
  format;
* ``duration``: the physical duration of the observation in s;
* ``saa``: flag instructing xpobssim to consider (i.e., exclude) the SAA
  passages when calculating the good time intervals (default: False);
* ``occult``: flag instructing xpobssim to consider (i.e., exclude) the time
  interval when the target is occulted by the Earth when calculating the good
  time intervals (default: False)

Since version 8.6.0 xpobssim is equipped to properly take into account the SAA
and the Earth occultation in the calculation of the good time intervals, although
it does not do that by default (i.e., you have to enable the two corresponding
command-line switches for that to happen). Note that, if you run with the
``saa`` and ``occult`` flags enabled, your effective on time will be roughly
55% of the physical duration (this is what will happen in real life).

.. warning::
  In a future ixpeobssim version the ``saa`` and ``occult`` flags will be
  enabled by default. In the meantime, any test of the new functionality is
  welcome.


Source visibility
-----------------

When dealing with sensitivity studies, most of the times one is concerned with
the total source ontime (i.e., the sum of all good time intervals) rather that
the wall-clock duration of the observation, given that the latter has to be
accommodated in the context of the overall observing plan. The combined impact
of the SAA and Earth occultation will reduce the good time intervals to 53--87%
of the total duration of the observation, with the particular value depending
almost exclusively on the declination of the source position. Running
simulations with all the physical effects (including the SAA passages and Earth
occultations) enabled is instructive for estimating the amount of net exposure
for a given observation.

In order to help the users planning an observation, and with all the caveats
above, as of version 8.6.0 ixpeobssim provides a rough visibility tool
(``xpvisibility.py``) summarizing the relevant information, as illustrated in
the figure below.

.. _figure-ixpe_visibility_tool:
.. figure:: figures/misc/ixpe_visibility_tool.*

For reference, the output of

.. code-block::

   xpvisibility.py --srcname Crab --startdate 2021-01-01

includes some basic statistics about the duration of the observation, the total
sum of good-time internals and the periods when the source is observable due
to time constraints.

Dithering
---------

In nominal data-taking configuration the IXPE observatory is dithered around the
pointing direction, the main reason for that being averaging out the spurious
modulation and making correcting for that practically possible.

The dithering pattern has the basic form

.. math::
  \delta x &= A \cos(\omega_a t) \cos(\omega_x t) \\
  \delta y &= A \sin(\omega_a t) \sin(\omega_y t)

with a default amplitude of 1.6 arcsec and the three periods corresponding to the
angular pulsations in a, x and y being 907 s, 101 s and 449 s, respectively.

.. figure:: figures/misc/ixpe_dithering_path.*
   :width: 80%

   Representation of the default IXPE dithering path for a 10 ks observation.

When convolved with the PSF of the instrument, the dithering pattern provides
a image on the focal plane that is approximately uniform (within a factor of 2)
for a point source.

.. figure:: figures/misc/ixpe_dithering_psf.*
   :width: 80%

   Representation of the dithered image of a point source on the IXPE focal plane.


Pointing history
----------------

The pointing history is written in a dedicated extension of the IXPE photon lists
called ``SC_DATA``, with the exact structure described in the section about
:ref:`datafmt`.

The pointing history is written at regular time intervals, and the time step can
be set from command line. Tests show that a 10 s interval provides a maximum
error of 0.15 arcsec in the pointing direction in the sky, when the latter is
reconstructed via an interpolated spline from the ``SC_DATA`` table. A 5 s time
interval provides a sub-arcsec error in the reconstructed pointing direction.
